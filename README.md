Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

1. run-analysis.R script creates 2 tidy datasets containing information about human activity measurements derived from sensors embedded in smartphones. Specifically, the script downloads, stores, and manipulates human activity recognition data collected by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, and Xavier Parra (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones). These data reflect information collected by 30 subjects performing 6 distinct activities while wearing a smartphone with embedded sensors. The two tidy datasets, built consistent with tidy data principles, present the study data in an accessible and organized fashion. The script requires no input files but does make use of data.table and dplyr packages. The script's key outputs are (1) hardata.csv and (2) haravgdata.csv (stored in a newly created data sub-directory within the user's R working directory).  

2. CodeBook.md provides key background and metadata information for the two datasets: hardata and haravgdata. The first dataset, hardata (n=10,299 variables=69), integrates multiple files to present key human activity recognition (har) measures in an accessible, efficient data format. The second dataset, haravgdata (n=36 variables=67), presents the mean or average values of the variables in hardata by human subject and by human activity.
